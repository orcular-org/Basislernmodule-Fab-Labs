# Basic learning modules for fab labs
Basic learning modules for various topics related to the use of fab labs - published as Open Educational Resources (OER).

## Topic 1: 3D Models

1. [3D design](../Basislernmodule/1_1_3D_design/EN_3D_design.md)
2. [3D scanning](../Basislernmodule/1_2_3D_scanning/EN_3D_scanning.md)
3. [Using 3D models from the Internet](../Basislernmodule/1_3_Using_3D_models_from_the_internet/EN_Using_3D_models_from_the_internet.md)

## Topic 2: Digital production

1. [3D printing](../Basislernmodule/2_1_3D_printing/EN_3D_printing.md)
2. [Laser cutting](../Basislernmodule/2_2_Laser_cutting/EN_Laser_cutting.md)
3. [CNC milling](../Basislernmodule/2_3_CNC_milling/EN_CNC_milling.md)

## Aims of the basic learning modules

The basic learning modules are intended to introduce various topics related to the use of fab labs. Their main purpose is to spark interest in their use, to demonstrate potential applications and to teach basic application skills.

Since every Fab Lab, every device and every software is different, no device- or lab-specific knowledge is provided, but rather general basic knowledge. Furthermore, it is not the goal to teach detailed practical knowledge - rather, the basic knowledge from these learning modules serves as preparation for practical workshops that are typically offered in fab labs.

## Open Source & Open Education

The basic learning modules are published as so-called Open Educational Resources (OER), which means as free learning and teaching materials. They thus fulfill typical requirements that are placed on open-source projects:
- The content is free of charge and accessible to everyone.
- They are published under an open license that allows the use, copying and further editing under certain conditions (e.g. attributing the source) - in this case under the  [Creative Commons License CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). In addition, care has been taken to ensure that any imagery used has also been published under a Creative Commons license or other open license - details of which can be found at the end of each basic learning module in the "image references" section. More about Creative Commons licenses [in this basic learning module](../Basislernmodule/1_3_Using_3D_models_from_the_internet/EN_Using_3D_models_from_the_internet.md).
- The source code (in this case in [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with minor additions in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)) is open-sourced - viewable on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/orcular-org/Basislernmodule-Fab-Labs).
- The learning modules are open for improvement and further development with the help of the community, e.g. by correcting errors or adding further content.

In this case, this means: If readers notice errors or have suggestions for additions, it is appreciated if they are communicated. The best way to do this is to create an "issue" or a "pull request" here on GitHub. This requires a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).

## Background

The basic learning modules were developed by Hamburg Innovation GmbH as an open educational resource and further developed and revised for use on the [TOLOCAR.org](https://tolocar.org/en/) website as part of the TOLOCAR project and supplemented with an English and Ukrainian version (TOLOCAR is a project funded by the German government @bmz_bund and implemented by GIZ).
